#How-to Knowledge
Process & Procedures

##Declarative vs Imperative Knowledge
Declarative (Maths) vs Imperative (Computer Science)

Declarative knowledge is useful for "what is" or "what should be" type statements. Imperative knowledge is useful for how-to statements. 

##Complexity

Physical designers have to worry about physical limits. Computer Science deal with idealized components. There is less difference between what i can imagine and what i can do.

An abstract form of engineering.

##Techniques
###Black-Box Abstraction

Why? So you can build big boxes from smaller boxes. Example : Box that calculates square root.

Another reason to define even more general knowledge - boxes that may build boxes.

###Conventional Interfaces
Ways of joining things

Generic Operations
Large scale structure modularity
OOPs
Operations on Aggregates

###Metalinguistic Abstraction
Construct new languages, a new design languag
Apply / Eval loop
Build languages
