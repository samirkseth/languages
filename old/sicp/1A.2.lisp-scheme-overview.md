#How to Learn a Language
What are the primitives?
What are the means of combination?
What are the means of abstraction?

#Lisp-Scheme

Primitives :
Symbols or Atoms : 
    3, 124, 5 ..

Combinations : 
               (+ 3 124 5)
               (+ 3 (+ 4 5) 8 2)

               Fully parenthesized
               (operator <operand1> <operand2> ...)
               An operand may itself be a combination
               Prefix Order
               Tree View of Combination
               + ----------------
               |    |     |    |
               3    + --  8    2
                    |  |
                    4  5

Abstraction:
    
    (define b (+ 3 (+ 4 5) 8 2))

function with parameters

    (define 
        (square x) 
            (* x x))

this is actually syntactic sugar for :

    (define 
        (square 
            (lambda(x)
                (* x x))))

square has a value which is a function value. 

You can use abstractions as if they were primitives.

Case Analysis :

    (define (abs x)
        (cond   ((< x 0) (- x))
                ((= x 0) 0)
                ((> x 0) x)))

You can also write :

    (define (abs x)
                (if (< x 0)
                    (-x)
                    (x)))

if / cond can be syntactic sugar for the other.

Recursion

    sqrt procedure

Block Structure

    packaging internals inside of a definition
    sqrt with local definitions
    block scoped variables
